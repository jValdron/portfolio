Iâ€™m a bit of a jack of all trades, I know my way around application development, cloud computing, servers, electronics and many other things.</p><p>I've focused most of my career building web applications, I know my way around browser quirks, how to build an HTML/CSS integration of an existing design quickly and efficiently, create an efficient and responsive API/backend and how to manage applications on the cloud.</p><p>My passion lies in automating tasks all around me. From business needs, to home automation, if there is a way to make a process more efficient, you can bet I'll make it more efficient.</p><p>More recently, I've been focusing my career on site reliability engineering principals and practices; mainly around infrastructure, as this is what I truly enjoy.</p>"
